1.Understand Recursive Algorithms
Recursion Overview:
•	Concept:  Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is often used to break down complex problems into simpler ones.
•	Components:
•	Base Case: The condition under which the recursion stops. It prevents infinite recursion and provides the result for the simplest instance of the problem.
•	Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with a modified argument to work towards the base case.
Example of Recursion:
•	Factorial Calculation: n!=n×(n−1)!  with the base case 0!=1.

2. Setup
Define the Problem:
•	We want to predict the future value of an investment based on its past growth rate. This can be done using a recursive approach where we predict the value for each future period.
Formula for Future Value Calculation: Future Value=Current Value×(1+Growth Rate) power of n , Where n  is the number of periods.

4.Analysis
Time Complexity of Recursive Algorithm:
•	Time Complexity: The time complexity of the calculateFutureValue function is O (n), where n is the number of periods. This is because the function makes n recursive calls.
•	Space Complexity: The space complexity is also O (n) due to the stack space used by recursive calls. Each call adds a new frame to the call stack.

Optimizing Recursive Solution:
1.	Memorization:
o	Store the results of previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations. This is particularly useful for problems where the same sub problems are solved multiple times.
2.	Iterative Solution:
o	For this specific problem, an iterative approach could be more efficient. Here’s how you might implement it:
